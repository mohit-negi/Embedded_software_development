To add a file to the repository

creating and staging file for commit
1.touch filename.extension
2.vi - filename.extension	-- to edit it in vim(press esc :q! to quit && hold esc  :x to save made changes to file)
3.git add (filename.extension) or (.) -- to stage it for commit
4.now check whether it is being tracked or not by
 git status
5.git commit -m "comments to add"
----------------------------------

to clear the made commits 
1.git reset <commit id> --> id from which you want to remove the commits

-----------------------------------
Now if you want to make some changes to some files without commiting to them 
we can use a feature named as stashing --more like private version control

1.git stash	-- to stash the changes made in a file 
	(note: the made changes is stored in automatically created file)
2.git stash pop  -- to bring the made changes in the log
3. git stash clear -- to clear the made stash

-------------------------------------

Now to make changes in git repository

1.git remote add origin <url to the repository>

2.git remote -v  ---to know what changes are we authorized to made

3.git push origin master

         ^    ^    ^

 push - to push the made commits to the said repository
 origin - it indicates that we are making changes to the origin (in this case that is repository)
 master - at what branch you're ammending changes
 
----------------------------------------------------

Now what is branching and how it is done

Branching is version control usually used in open source projects and could be used in private projects to not mess up when working on complicated project
Go to https://learngitbranching.js.org/
to learn branching it in an interactive way

Basic commands
1.git branch <branch name>	-- To create a new branch
2.git checkout <branch name>	-- for selecting to make changes in what branch
3.git merge <with:branch name>	-- To merge current branch with a branch


Things to keep in mind while commiting and making changes to the repository

Instead of making ammends to the original master(main) branch if we want to make changes to some other branch first checkout and commit to the said branch and then :-
git push origin <master : branch name> -- instead of master branch add the branch name of the selected branch
----------------------------------------------------------

Fork -- Usually used to make a clone of the original repository and to copy it to the local or personal repository
1st step is to click the fork option and copy the link 
2nd step is to git clone <link of the forked repository>
and then start working upon it

further topic is upstreaming we will work on that
